What does APLib mean? Well, it means "**All Purpose Library**". This is a library for [**Minecraft's Computercraft**](https://computercraft.cc) and that aims to make a lot of things much easier to do (like drawing on the screen or making GUIs).
I advise you to check the [**examples**](./examples) or [**the old attempt to a documentation**](./docs) while the new documentation is being made.
